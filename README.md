# Screenshooter

Screenshooter is an application for touching-up screenshots before publishing.

## What is it not
1. It is not meant to replace image editors.
1. It is not a Photoshop killer.
1. It is not AI driven.
1. It does not send your data anywhere, lives and stays in your browser. Unplug if you are paranoid;)

## What does it do
Touch-up tools:
1. blur rect

*Very* Basic Image editor
1. Put pixel / rect of color
2. Zoom/Rotate
3. Crop (todo)
4. Text (todo)

## What is the status
1. Works for me (tm)
2. Some things are not implemented (marked todo)
3. Output is png or jpg, quality is not selectable

## Can I...
1. Use it - sure just go here, if it works for you I'm happy.
2. fork it - sure just hit them github buttons
3. slice and dice it - sure, take what ever parts make sense
4. send you a pull request - sure, thanks!
5. send you a bug report / feature request - sure, thanks!
6. ask you to do something for free in the next day - nope :D

This software was made to be useful. But it comes with absolutely no warranty!

Happy hacking.
